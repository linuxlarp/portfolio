Hello there! I'm linuxlarp. Also known as ThinkpadEnjoyer

I'm a 15yo, self-taught developer with a interest in aviation, open-source software, and the right-to-repair movement. I'm currently working towards my Private Pilot License (PPL), under the FAA while completing dual-credit aviation courses through my local highschool.

Most of my projects are built for Roblox and Discord, where i develop systems, backend logic, automation tools and community-focused features. While many of my applications live on those platforms. The underlying work involves real software development, scripting, systems design. Debugging and scalability.

Im continuing to branch out into broader software engineering, including backend services. Linux systems, and hands on SysAdmin. I enjoy building projects that improve quality of life, solve practical problems, or fill gaps where better tools are needed.

I also run a Linux-focused social media page with 2,500+ combined followers, and 1M+ views on both Tiktok and Instagram. Where i post Linux jokes, Commentary and "larping" content, where I just either flex fastfetch or technology.
