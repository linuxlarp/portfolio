Hello there! My name is linuxlarp or linuxlarper.

Currently 15 years old, self-taught developer, aviation enthusiast, open source & right to repair advocate.

Working on my Private Pilots License (PPL) under the FAA, and enrolled in dual-credit aviation courses at a local highschool.

Most of my projects are for Roblox, Discord and social media platforms but im always expanding my skills and expertises to communities, platforms, causes and needs.

I love tinkering and "larping" with Linux as my name suggests. I also love homelabbing on my Raspberry Pi 5 and Dell Optiplex 7010.

And when im not doing any of the above, you can probably find me:
- Studying 
- Lifting 󱅝
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 
- Drinking more Caffine because: more espresso, less depresso 
