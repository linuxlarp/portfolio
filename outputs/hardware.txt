󰇅 My Full Setup:
-------------------------
 Motherboard: GIGABYTE B650M WIFI GAMING PLUS
󰻠 CPU: AMD Ryzen 7700X
 RAM: TEAMGROUP T-FORCE Delta RGB DDR5 48GB (16GB x 3)
 GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4060Ti
 PSU: MSI MAG A650BN 650W
󰇅 Case: Proprietary Prebuilt
󰈐 AIO: Proprietary with custom CORSAIR ICUE LINK RX140 140mm (2x)
 Storage: 2TB Generic SSD, 1TB Samsung 990 PRO

While this is a prebuilt, I've done many upgrades and changes over the years! I am planning to eventually do a huge upgrade and swapping the GPU, PSU, and redoing the cooling system with a new case.

 Thinkpad:
-------------------------
 Make: Lenovo
󰣩 Model: X1 Carbon, Gen 7
󰻠 CPU: Intel i5-8365U "Coffeelake"
󰻠 GPU: Integrated
 RAM: 16GB DDR4
 Storage: 512GB Generic SSD

I use this thing for high school stuff, college work, and aviation studies. Honestly, nothing beats posting up at a coffee shop and just going through homework or coding on it. I grabbed it refurbished, and the battery life was trash. So I threw in an iFixit battery and called it good.

󰟑 Homelab:
-------------------------
 Make: DELL
󰣩 Model: OPTIPLEX 7010
󰻠 CPU: i3-3220
 RAM: 4GB DDR3
 GPU: Intel® HD Graphics 2500
 PSU: DELL Propietary 250
󰇅 Case: OPTIPLEX 7010 SFF
󰈐 Cooling: Single Fan Blower Motor

My schools technology department was kind enough to hand one of these to me completely serviceable, I now run Debian Server and host most of my applications and personal use stuff on it. (In fact, you're using it right now by reading this!)

As for the setup, I modified it by replacing thermal paste, removing the default SATA HDD and replacing it with a 1TB SSD SATA I had laying around. And just stripped off the front panel since it didn't fit properly.

While its not very powerful, does a good job and serves it purpose.
