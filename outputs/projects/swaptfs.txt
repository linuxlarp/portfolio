Southwest Airlines PTFS 󰋑

SWAPTFS was a personal project, attempting to realistically recreate the operations of the IRL Southwest Airlines in Roblox's PTFS (Pilot Training Flight Simulator)

With this project, I used several skills to help properly run, develop and manage the group.  These skills include:
- Using Photoshop  to create advertisements, server embeds, logos, and other graphics for the group.
- Using Discord  to manage the community, communicate with members, and provide support.
- Using Python , TypeScript , JavaScript , and FastAPI  & NextJS  to create a fully functional website.
- Using my knowledge of aviation to create realistic flight operations, procedures and handbooks for the staff team.

I ran the group from 2024 - 2025, before retiring the group due to burnout, school, and personal reasons.
The group was acknowledged by another server in this community (PTC News) and was nominated in their yearly awards for "Best Technology" and "Best Airline",
The airline also additionally amassed 900 members before being handed off to a new CEO.

While i am not directly involved with the group anymore, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with SWAPTFS and the skills I was able to develop during my time running the group.

The code for the backend of the website is now available for free under the %LINK:MIT:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License% license.

I still host and run the website for the current CEO under a fixed contract.
