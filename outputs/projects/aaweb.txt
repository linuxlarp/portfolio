AAWeb 

A simple, HTML , CSS  and JS  website for the American Airlines PTFS Group. The website was never finished, but has a basic authentication manager and startpage.

The website was never finished, but overall was a great learning experience for web development and working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
